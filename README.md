# Multi-Class Animal Classification

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for multi-class classification of animal images using deep learning. The model is trained to classify images into different animal categories using a convolutional neural network (CNN).

## Features
- Image classification using deep learning.
- Uses a pre-trained model (or custom CNN).
- Handles multiple animal classes.
- Provides accuracy metrics and visualizations.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV (if required for image processing)

### Install dependencies
Run the following command to install required libraries:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib opencv-python
```

## Dataset
- The dataset consists of labeled images of different animals.
- Ensure your dataset is properly formatted and placed in the correct directory before running the notebook.
- If using a publicly available dataset, specify the source.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Multi_Class_Animal_Classification.ipynb
   ```
3. Run the notebook cell by cell to train and test the model.

## Results
- The model achieves an accuracy of XX% (update with actual results).
- Sample classification results and confusion matrix visualizations are available in the notebook.
